# Sound nRF Toolbox
 
Sound nRF is an extended version of the nRF Toolbox which can be found at https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-nRF-Toolbox. This manual provides the code explanation how to add sound synchronization with cadence data to the nRF Toolbox app. It also shows how to enable/re-enable sound for 2-minutes when the presented cadence deviates by 15.

## Requirements.
- An Android IDE for Android operating system such as Android Studio (https://developer.android.com/studio)
- An Android Mobile Smartphone. Sound nRF Toolbox is currently compatible to android devices. For assurance, android 10 update is ideal.
- A Sensor device with BLE supported that provides RSC (Running speed and cadence) data. e.g. Stryd
